It worked, macOS is nice to look at, but over the years it seems the focus of Apple is more on looks and politics than usability. Rogue processes that hog the system and numerous other bloatware that is just simply in the way of getting things done. The closed ecosystem works for syncing all devices and that's really nice but recently it's getting harder and harder to work with it, it's not working with me or for me but more and more against me. That's not what I want from an operating system and certainly not from an expensive piece of equipment.</p>\n<p>And now there's macOS Tahoe. With the \"glass\" interface. Which basically means there's rounded corners on everything and everywhere, with backgrounds bleeding through. There is no consistency in UI as everyrthign depends on what is behind the current window. I very much do noy want that, it distracts me from what I'm doing. I want focus, not more distraction. <strong><em>What The Actual Fuck is Apple thinking?</em></strong> It serves no purpose in usabiliity, in fact it get's in the way even more. Why???</p>\n<p>So I’m moving to <strong>Omarchy</strong>, an opinionated Hyprland Arch installation designed for developers who want control, speed and getting things done.</p>\n<p><em>To be real, I’m not fully moving away from macOS. I use an M3 Max 128GB model, which is still great for running medium sized AI models for inference, and it’s portable which my workstation isn’t. Also, I just use any OS when I see a need for it, I’m not married to one (OpenBSD, I love you).</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"omarchy-the-onestop-shop-for-developers\">Omarchy: The One‑Stop Shop for Developers<a href=\"#omarchy-the-onestop-shop-for-developers\" class=\"anchor text-muted\"><i class=\"fas fa-hashtag\"></i></a></h3>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\"><strong>What is Omarchy?</strong><br>A ready‑to‑run Arch Linux distro that ships with Hyprland, a full dev stack, and an opinionated package set tuned for modern (web) development. <a href=\"https://omarchy.org/\" target=\"null\">Omarchy website.</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"highlights\">Highlights<a href=\"#highlights\" class=\"anchor text-muted\"><i class=\"fas fa-hashtag\"></i></a></h4>\n<div class=\"table-wrapper\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Feature</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Why It Matters</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hyprland</strong></td>\n<td>Dynamic tiling, GPU‑accelerated compositing, ideal for managing dozens of applications.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Pre‑installed stack</strong></td>\n<td>Most of what I need to build and ship SaaS apps.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Configurable</strong></td>\n<td>Declarative config, reproducible builds, instant results.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>GPU support</strong></td>\n<td>Full NVIDIA driver stack for my GPUs.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"vscode--github-copilot-the-new-pair-programming-duo\">VS Code + GitHub Copilot: The New Pair Programming Duo<a href=\"vscode--github-copilot-the-new-pair-programming-duo\" class=\"anchor text-muted\"><i class=\"fas fa-hashtag\"></i></a></h3>\n<p>VS Code on Linux feels like a natural extension of the editor I used on macOS, but with open‑source flexibility:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cross‑platform consistency.</li>\n<li>Robust extensions.</li>\n<li>Seamless AI integration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Copilot turns my comments into working code snippets, letting me prototype API routes or components in seconds.

But the same infrastructure can host a Plex or Jellyfin instance with zero additional cost. In fact, the array is already mostly up and running.</p>\n<p>Specs for the interested:</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2572%; vertical-align: top;\"><strong>Component</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 75.7428%;\"><strong>Why I like it</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2572%; vertical-align: top;\"><strong>E5-2667 V4 (2x)</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 75.7428%;\">These are 8 core 16 thread CPUs with a base clock of 3.2GHz, a single core turbo boost of 3.5GHz and a sustained all core boost of 3.4GHz. 32 threads total, great for many VMs and fast enough for 1080p gaming.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2572%;\"><strong>128GB DDR4 ECC 2400 RAM</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 75.7428%;\">This gives plenty of headroom for all the VMs and leaves some for Unraid.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2572%; vertical-align: top;\"><strong>RTX 5060 Ti 16GB (2x)</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 75.7428%;\">Great budget cards for 1080p gaming and AI inference. The memory bandwidth is 448 GB/s, which is very close to an M3 Max. Two of them deliver 32GB of VRAM, which is very nice for a budget system.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2572%; vertical-align: top;\"><strong>HP Z Turbo Drive Quad Pro</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 75.7428%;\">A PCIe card that offers 4 NVME slots, as the Z840 doesn’t have that natively. I use 2 NVME slots for the gaming VMs and the rest for Unraid cache pool (where the other VMs live). The drives are small 256GB, but enough for now. The Z Turbo also has a bunch of beafy capacitors that keep the drives powered in case of power failure, to wfinish writing data to the drives. </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 24.2572%; vertical-align: top;\"><strong>SAS Drives (4x)</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 75.7428%;\">The Z840 has a SAS controller, so 4x 4TB (and a spare) were acquired from a sale. They are used but have only a year and half on them. </td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>All in all the cost of the whole system was around 1500 moneys (usd or euro, close enough). That is a pretty good deal if you ask me, considering the only other solution to get 32GB of VRAM is an RTX 5090. The 5090 costs 2000 at least, without a computer. It is exactly 4x faster though. Meh, I’ll survive, and if I need something fast I’ll use the cloud for the job.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"building-and-locally-hosting-saas-apps\">Building and Locally Hosting SaaS Apps<a href=\"#building-and-locally-hosting-saas-apps\" class=\"anchor text-muted\"><i class=\"fas fa-hashtag\"></i></a></h3>\n<p>With this stack, I can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Develop</strong> locally in an isolated Omarchy VM, optionally with another VM that mirrors production.</li>\n<li><strong>Test</strong> Docker containers on the fly; Unraid’s Docker spins up everything quite smoothly.</li>\n<li><strong>Deploy</strong> to a local private cluster for test or push to a public cloud with minimal friction.</li>\n<li><strong>Scale</strong> by adding more VMs (e.g., another VM instance) or spinning up additional containers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Because all services run on the same hardware, I can monitor CPU/GPU usage easily and tweak resource limits on the fly, no need to spin up expensive cloud instances for load testing.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"6-the-joy-factor\"><span class=\"me-2\">The Joy Factor</span><a href=\"#6-the-joy-factor\" class=\"anchor text-muted\"><i class=\"fas fa-hashtag\"></i></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Control</strong>: Omarchy lets me shape my OS exactly how I want it.</li>\n<li><strong>Privacy</strong>: No more weird daemons analyzing every single image, possibly calling back to Cupertino.</li>\n<li><strong>Productivity</strong>: VS Code + Copilot turns writing code into a creative act.</li>\n<li><strong>Power</strong>: Unraid on the Z840 shows that older hardware can still do big things, gaming, dev, and dev/test hosting.</li>\n<li><strong>Community</strong>: Engaging with peers who share the same passion keeps me inspired. I’ve found X to be a great place now, after being away for 10 years when Twitter started to suck.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re stuck in a closed ecosystem or looking to build scalable web services on a single machine, consider this approach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick an <em>opinionated</em> distro (Omarchy) for minimal setup overhead.</li>\n<li>Use VS Code + Copilot for rapid development (or any other combination, they are very much alike with subtle differences).</li>\n<li>Re-purpose existing hardware with Unraid, GPU pass-through for gaming, Omarchy VM for dev, Docker/k3s for SaaS hosting.</li>\n<li>Monitor and tweak resource usage to keep everything humming.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts<a href=\"#final-thoughts\" class=\"anchor text-muted\"><i class=\"fas fa-hashtag\"></i></a></h3>\n<p>Technology should <em>serve</em> us, not the other way around. When we give ourselves a flexible, open‑source stack, full control over hardware, AI‑augmented coding, and an easy path from local dev to production, we unlock creativity and joy that were once hidden behind corporate walls. Okay, this last sentence is a bit over the top but you get the gist.</p>\n<p>Give it a try: set up Omarchy on Arch (<a href=\"https://github.com/omacom-io/omarchy-iso\">Work on Omarchy ISO on Github</a>), run VS Code with Copilot, spin Unraid on your workstation, and watch as your web apps, SaaS products, and gaming sessions coexist peacefully. The spark of discovery is back, and it’s brighter than ever.</p>\n<p><strong>Happy hacking!</strong></p>\n<p><em>PS: yes, I used AI to prepare this post, but I heavily redacted it to reflect my personal opinions.
